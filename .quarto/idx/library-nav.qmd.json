In this section, we’ll cover most of the functions and how you can fully utilize them in Elumity.\n\n\nElumity features 3 distinct modules - Library, Cards, and Quiz. All three of them are switchable directly from the top navigation bar.\n\n\n![Elumity top navigation bar.](top-navbar.png)\n\n\nClick on any of the three items on the left side of the Search bar and you’ll be switching between them. Your data will automatically be saved and your chapter tree is shared between the modules, making organization a breeze.\n\n# Search Bar\n\nThe Search Bar is one of Elumity’s essential features. Depending on which module or chapter you’re in, it will adapt and allow you to search for files specific to that section.\n\n\n![Elumity main search bar.](search-bar.png)\n\n\nIn order to access and use it, simply click on the empty field box of the Search Bar itself and search through your documents.\n\n# Chapter Filter\n\nWhile the search bar is powerful, its feature set searches through the highlighted chapters or modules. If you want to search through your available Chapters, please use the Chapter Filter Bar which is located right above your Chapter Tree.\n\n![Elumity chapter filter.](chapter-filter.png)\n\n\n# Advanced Search\n\nBy default, the Search functionality doesn’t include the content from your PDF files, so it instead only relies on searching through the titles of all individual files as well as reference names.\n\nClicking on the three-dot menu of the search bar allows you to expand your search, giving you options such as searching the entire text document, matching the whole word, matching the Case as well as doing a fuzzy search.\n\n# Notifications\n\nThe first item on the right-hand side of the Top Nav Bar is the Notifications dropdown. This is where your notifications live. After saving your favorite topics in Medline (see 2.5), you’ll receive alerts every time there’s a large enough amount of your favorite topics.\n\n# Feedback\n\nYour Feedback is of absolute importance to us.
